# Patch Generation
 
This repository is based on parts of the adversarial-robustness-toolbox (ART): https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox

The repository allows to interactively generate an [Adversarial Patch](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09665) using a white-box attack on [Yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)

## Usage:

Run the notebook [Adversarial-Patch-ART-Collusion.ipynb](Patch_Generation.ipynb), which should be self-explanatory. It will install the required dependencies automatically, so it's advised to run it in a virtual environment.
