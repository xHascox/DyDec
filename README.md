DyDec (DynamicDeception) provides an implementation of a Collusion Attack on Autonomous Driving Agents

## Structure:
* The fork of **adversarial-robustness-toolbox** (ART) includes the implementation of our attack algorithm
* **Patch Generation** includes the attack configuration and execution
* **Simulation Testing** includes the simulation testing in CARLA and the dataset collection
